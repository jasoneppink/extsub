# Multicaptions

Multicaptions is an open source captioning technology for media installations in museums, galleries, and other public institutions that accommodates opt-in viewing of captions in multiple languages without impinging on the video image.

Running on a Raspberry Pi, Multicaptions displays fullscreen video (up to full HD) while simultaneously processing and displaying subtitles in one or more selectable languages on a separate graphic LCD or VFD display. It is an affordable, easy-to-build, easy-to-maintain, open source project using completely off-the-shelf hardware.

Multicaptions is inspired by [Figaro System's Simultext](http://www.figaro-systems.com/simultextreg.html) (known as ["Met Titles"](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/02/arts/reinventing-supertitles-how-the-met-did-it.html?pagewanted=all) at the NYC Metropolitan Opera).

## Setup and Installation
See [LCD](https://github.com/jasoneppink/multicaptions/tree/LCD) or [VFD](https://github.com/jasoneppink/multicaptions/tree/VFD) branches for detailed instructions.

## Notes
Multicaptions currently requires that SRT files for the same video have the same number of subtitles with the same start and end times, regardless of language, with a maximum of two lines per subtitle. (e.g. The demo video has 88 subtitles.)

## Thanks
* Big ups to @olikraus for their indispensible [u8g2 library](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2), without which none of this would be possible.
* Many thanks to Moe Jangda for his work getting the Raspberry Pi to talk to the LCD display.
* High fives to [Sean McIntyre](https://github.com/boxysean) for polishing refactoring my code.
